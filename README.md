 Incident Response Plan Capybara Unlimited

A structured, NIST-aligned Incident Response Plan developed to support Capybara Unlimited in effective preparation, detection, response, and recovery from cybersecurity incidents. This project reflects complete understanding of the IR lifecycle processes, communication pathways, regulatory requirements, and practical playbooks in use within modern security operations.


Designed a comprehensive IRP mapped onto the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle, including Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Post-Incident Review.

Clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of SOC analysts, incident command, forensics, IT administrators, legal/compliance, and communication teams to facilitate organized response activities.

Spearheaded the creation of a comprehensive Communication Plan, covering internal reporting flows, customer notifications, regulatory disclosures (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA), and approved public messaging.

Measurable KPIs included Time to Detect, Time to Contain, Time to Recover, Incident Closure Rate, and Post-Incident Improvement Rate to monitor IR performance and maturity.

Wrote incident playbooks for Malware, Phishing, and Denial-of-Service with detailed steps in technical/procedural actions to respond quickly and consistently across teams.

Added guidance on common incident response mistakes, plus mitigation strategies to reduce errors, improve documentation, and maintain operational readiness.



This project is ideal for demonstrating capabilities in:

Incident Response planning and execution

NIST-aligned security processes

Communication strategy during high-pressure events

Playbook creation and technical response workflows

Metrics-driven security operations and continuous improvement
